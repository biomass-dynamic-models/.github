# Biomass dynamic models

Biomass dynamic models, also called surplus production models, are a class of population dynamic models that consider all population cohorts to be aggregated into a single measure of the population size. These models are useful in instances where there is no information on cohort size, such as length- or age-fequency data, or when we have limited information on the maturity or selectivity ogives.
